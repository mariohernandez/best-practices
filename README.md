## Why Guidelines and Not Rules

Rules will beget rule-followers and rule-breakers; rule-enforcers and rule-lawyers. A team of these kinds of folks becomes toxic very quickly.

Guidelines are suggestions and warnings based on experience. Guidelines make story tellers out of experienced teammates and daredevils out of the new ones.

A guideline is merely a cautionary tale based on past experiences. That’s how guidelines should be written, and that’s how they should be followed.

### Style and Structure of Guidance

These guidelines use words like "favor", "prefer", "try", and "avoid" instead of "do" and "don't". This is to reenforce the idea that they are not strict rules.

Any particular piece of guidance will follow the outline:

* Prefer
* Avoid
* Use Instead
* Underlying Principle

This is to re-enforce the idea that they are based on learned experiences and are not arbitrary.
